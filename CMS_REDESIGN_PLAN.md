# Enterprise CMS Redesign Plan - Magento-like Architecture

## Current Assessment:
The previous restructuring was too basic. Need a complete enterprise-grade CMS system with:
- Advanced SEO management with live previews
- Separate content types and structured content
- Magento-like modular architecture
- Professional dashboard design
- Content staging and versioning

## New Architecture Vision:

### 1. Content Types System
- **Pages**: Regular content pages with templates
- **Blocks**: Reusable content components (headers, footers, banners)
- **Widgets**: Dynamic content elements
- **Templates**: Layout templates with regions

### 2. SEO Management System
- Real-time Google search preview
- Advanced metadata management
- Schema.org structured data
- SEO scoring and recommendations

### 3. Dashboard Structure
```
/admin/cms/
  /dashboard          - Overview with analytics
  /pages/            - Page management
  /blocks/           - Content blocks
  /widgets/          - Dynamic widgets
  /templates/        - Template management
  /seo/              - SEO tools and analytics
  /content-staging/  - Staging environment
```

### 4. Database Schema Enhancements
- Content versioning system
- SEO metadata with scoring
- Content relationships
- Revision history
- Staging vs production content

### 5. Key Features to Implement:

#### SEO Module:
- Live Google search result preview
- Meta title/description generators
- Keyword analysis
- Open Graph and Twitter Card management
- XML sitemap management

#### Content Management:

- Content staging and publishing workflow
- Multi-language support
- Content scheduling
- Bulk operations

#### Advanced Features:

## Implementation Phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Enhanced database schema
- Basic SEO preview functionality
- Content type system foundation

### Phase 2: Advanced CMS
- Visual content editor
- Content staging
- Advanced SEO tools

### Phase 3: Enterprise Features

## Technical Stack Enhancements:

This redesign will create a professional, enterprise-grade CMS system comparable to Magento's capabilities with modern React/Next.js implementation.
